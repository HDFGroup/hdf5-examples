# A script to reconfigure autotools for HDF5, and to recreate other
# generated files specifc to HDF5.
# If the paths of the autotools are not specified by the user, they
# are hardcoded to point to their locations on HDF5 Linux machines.
# Users can specify the locations of the autotools with the following
# variables:
# AUTOCONF, AUTOMAKE, ACLOCAL, AUTOHEADER should be the path to the
# corresponding tools.
# LIBTOOL_DIR should be the path to the base libtool directory;
# $LIBTOOL_DIR/bin/libtool should invoke libtool, while
# $LIBTOOL_DIR/share/aclocal needs to be included by aclocal.
# Be very careful when specifying these tools manually!  There are a lot
# of versions that can get confused (not even counting the m4 utility)!

# HDF5 currently uses the following versions of the autotools:
AUTOCONF_VERSION="autoconf (GNU Autoconf) 2.68"
AUTOMAKE_VERSION="automake (GNU automake) 1.11.1"
AUTOHEADER_VERSION="autoheader (GNU Autoconf) 2.68"
ACLOCAL_VERSION="aclocal (GNU automake) 1.11.1"
LIBTOOL_VERSION="(GNU libtool) 2.4"
#
# When upgrading automake's version, don't forget to also update its
# helper utilities, especially depcomp.


# If paths to autotools are not specified by the user, assume tools are
# running on jam in /mnt/hdf/packages and set paths accordingly.
