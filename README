Example programs for HDF5

Some notes:

- This package is not meant to be installed, `make install' will do
nothing.

- This package supports VPATH builds (run configure from a different
directory), but will not automatically copy the data files some
examples need to run (*.h5) to the build directory.  This must be done
manually if you wish to run these examples from the build directory.
`make check' is supported with VPATH.

- To build only 1.6 examples, set environmental variable `H5EX_16' to
anything but null before runnning configure.  Similary to build only 1.8
examples, set `H5EX_18'.  These variables can be set temporarily in the
call to configure, e.g. `./configure H5EX_16=1'.  Alternatively you can
'make' in a subdirectory to only build examples under that directory.

- This package requires HDF5 Library version 1.8 or later.  If the
default h5cc is not the correct version, you must set CC to the path to
the correct h5cc.
