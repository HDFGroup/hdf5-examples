===========================================================================

After Installation
===========================================================================
The examples folder, HDF5Examples, located in the install folder,
can be built and tested with CMake and the supplied
HDF5_Examples.cmake file. The HDF5_Examples.cmake expects HDF5 to have
been installed in the default location with above compilers. Also, the CMake
utility should be installed.

To test the installation with the examples;
    Create a directory to run the examples.
    The default source folder is defined as "HDF5Examples". It can be changed
        with the CTEST_SOURCE_NAME script option.
    The default installation folder is defined as "@CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@".
        It can be changed with the INSTALLDIR script option.
    The default ctest configuration is defined as "Release". It can be changed
        with the CTEST_BUILD_CONFIGURATION script option. Note that this must
        be the same as the value used with the -C command line option.
    The default build configuration is defined to build and use static libraries.
        Shared libraries can be used with the STATICLIBRARIES script option set to "NO".
    Other options can be changed by editing the HDF5_Examples.cmake file.

    If the defaults are okay, execute from this directory:
        ctest -S HDF5_Examples.cmake -C Release -V -O test.log
    If the defaults need change, execute from this directory:
        ctest -S HDF5_Examples.cmake,CTEST_SOURCE_NAME=MyExamples,INSTALLDIR=MyLocation -C Release -V -O test.log

When executed, the ctest script will save the results to the log file, test.log, as
indicated by the ctest command. If you wish the to see more build and test information,
add "-VV" to the ctest command. The output should show;
      100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 156.

For more information see USING_CMake.txt in the install folder.
